# Saint Seiya Memory Game

### This is a simple memory game, made it as a Saint Seiya theme as it is my favorite anime.
## Objectives
- Click a card and then click another one to match the first one.
- If cards did not match try to memorize the location so next time you know where it is
- try to match all the card with as many little moves as posssible
- Saint Seiya theme at the bottom of the page if you like to listen to it.
